<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="https://iili.io/64LDl9.png" alt="Dashboard" >

The purpose of this project is to develope and deploy a music web application in which users are able to search for their favorite music, singer, band or genre and listen to them along with the specific lyrics.

Here's why:

- Noone likes to listen to music in one tab and look up the lyrics on the other; Unfortunately we dont live in a perfect world and many worldwide famous applications make you do that, still, in 2022, yes I'm looking at you Spotify! ðŸ˜‰
- Calling several APIs using a single server is something that we as a group have never done before and thought it'd be cool to do so.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life

Of course, no application is perfect, but this one is; At least we did our best!ðŸ˜…
