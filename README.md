<img src="https://iili.io/64LDl9.png" alt="Dashboard" >

The purpose of this project is to develope and deploy a web application in which users are able to review their Spotify profile and get a personalized playlist based on their listening habits. The application is built using the Spotify API and the Spotify Web API. The application is built using the MERN stack.

Here's a list of the main features:

- You can log in with your Spotify account
- You can see your top artists and tracks
- You can see your recently played tracks
- You can see your top genres
- You can see your top tracks and artists for a specific time range

Of course, no application is perfect, but this one is; At least we did our best!ðŸ˜…
